---

**✅ New ALICE v1.6.7**
🔹 1. True NLP Learning (like GPT)
Integrated a small local language model using transformers from Hugging Face.

ALICE can now understand more natural prompts, not just command keywords.

Lightweight model like distilgpt2 used to keep it compatible with your system.

🔹 2. Real Offline Model Training
Included a training mode: ALICE can fine-tune on custom text files or chat logs using a simplified interface.

Uses Hugging Face Trainer for small datasets.

Can be triggered via command: Train Offline.

🔹 3. Memory Persistence (Long-Term)
Saves important facts, user preferences, voice settings, and chat history to a file memory.json.

Memory is loaded on startup and saved on exit.

Supports command: Forget, Remember [thing], What do you remember?

🔹 4. Voice Command Input
Uses SpeechRecognition + pyaudio for microphone input.

“Hey ALICE” is now an actual voice trigger!

She can start listening when you say her name, and respond with voice.
